## What Is a Sprint

A sprint is a goal-oriented exercise that spans a short amount of time, usually one to two weeks, where members of the team work on tasks that are required to reach the set goal. Sprints center around a task management tool such as an agile board as well as specialized meetings that keep the communication between team members alive.

## Meetings

There are three important meetings for any agile team:

* Sprint Planning
* Daily Standup
* Retrospective

<br/>

### Sprint Planning

Sprint planning meetings happen before a sprint starts and are done so that the team as a whole can decide what the goals for the sprint are and what tasks are needed to achieve that goal.

<br/>

### Daily Standup

Daily standup meetings are done everyday and are a way for each team member to update other members of their progress. The three things that are asked from each member are as follows:

* What did you do yesterday?
* What are you planning to do today?
* Is there anything blocking your progress?

<br/>

### Retrospective

Retrospective meetings happen at the end of a sprint and are meant to be the team's way of reflecting and looking back at their performance during the whole sprint. Again, three things are asked from each team member:

* What went well?
* What didn't go well?
* How can we improve?
